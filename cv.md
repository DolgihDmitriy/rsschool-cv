## __About Myself__
---

I have been learning programming for 3 years now since I entered University.I'm third-year student of Bsuir and I've tried many languages but I was not enough interested in them, so I finally decide to stop on javascript.

Frankly speaking I would like to become frontend-developer.I may undoubtedly consider myself plodding and persistent person.I hope this course will help me to turn desire into reality.
