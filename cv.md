## __About Myself__
I have been learning programming for 3 years now since I entered University.I'm third-year student of Bsuir and I've tried many languages but I was not enough interested in them, so I finally decide to stop on javascript.

Frankly speaking I would like to become frontend-developer.I may undoubtedly consider myself plodding and persistent person.I hope this course will help me to turn desire into reality.

 ## __Code Example__
 **Duplicate Encoder kata from Codewars:** *The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.*

 ```
 function duplicateEncode(word){
  var mas = [];
  word = word.toLowerCase();
  for(var i=0;i<word.length;i++){
    var str = word.replaceAll(word[i],'');
    if(str.length == word.length - 1){
      mas.push('(');
    }
    else mas.push(')');
  }
  return mas.join('');
}
 ```
